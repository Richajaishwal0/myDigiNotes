# Presentation Outline For Threading Concept and Kernel Structures

### 1. **Introduction to Threading**
   - **Definition of Threads**:
     - Threads are the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled and executed by the CPU.
     - A thread consists of a program counter (PC), a stack, and a set of registers.
   - **Single-threaded vs Multi-threaded Applications**:
     - Single-threaded: Executes one task at a time.
     - Multi-threaded: Can execute multiple tasks simultaneously, leading to better CPU utilization and performance.
   
   **Why Use Threads?**
   - Improved performance through parallelism.
   - Efficient CPU utilization.
   - Simplified program structure for concurrent tasks (e.g., a web server handling multiple requests).

### 2. **Types of Threads**
   - **User-level Threads**:
     - Managed by the user-level library.
     - Faster to create and switch between, as the kernel is not involved.
     - Disadvantage: If one thread performs a blocking operation, all threads in the process are blocked (no true parallelism).
   - **Kernel-level Threads**:
     - Managed directly by the operating system's kernel.
     - True parallelism is possible, but they are slower to create and manage due to system overhead.
   - **Hybrid Models (Two-level threads)**:
     - Combine user and kernel threads. User threads are mapped to kernel threads, allowing both fast context switching and true parallelism.

### 3. **Threading Models**
   - **Many-to-One Model**:
     - Multiple user-level threads mapped to one kernel thread.
     - Fast context switching but no parallelism.
   - **One-to-One Model**:
     - Each user thread maps to a kernel thread.
     - True parallelism but with higher overhead due to increased number of kernel threads.
   - **Many-to-Many Model**:
     - Multiple user threads are mapped to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads.
     - Flexible, balancing between performance and system resource usage.

### 4. **Threading in Operating Systems**
   - **Thread Life Cycle**:
     1. **New**: Thread is created but not yet started.
     2. **Runnable**: Thread is ready to run, waiting for CPU allocation.
     3. **Running**: Thread is executing on the CPU.
     4. **Blocked**: Thread is waiting for I/O or other resources.
     5. **Terminated**: Thread has finished execution.

   - **Thread Scheduling**:
     - How the kernel determines which thread to run next.
     - Preemptive vs Cooperative scheduling.
     - **Preemptive Scheduling**: The OS can interrupt and switch threads.
     - **Cooperative Scheduling**: Threads yield control voluntarily.
   
   - **Multithreading Models in Popular OSes**:
     - **Linux**: Implements kernel threads via the **NPTL** (Native POSIX Thread Library) using a one-to-one model.
     - **Windows**: Uses a similar one-to-one model via the Windows API.

### 5. **Kernel Structures for Thread Management**
   - **Process Control Block (PCB)**:
     - The data structure in the kernel that represents a process.
     - Contains information such as process state, program counter, CPU registers, and memory management information.
   - **Thread Control Block (TCB)**:
     - A data structure that contains information about a thread.
     - Stores details like thread ID, stack pointer, program counter, state, priority, and registers.
   - **Relationship Between PCB and TCB**:
     - In multithreaded systems, a process has one PCB, but multiple TCBs corresponding to each thread.

### 6. **Thread Synchronization**
   - **The Need for Synchronization**:
     - Threads share data and resources, and without synchronization, race conditions and data inconsistencies can occur.
   - **Synchronization Mechanisms**:
     - **Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)**: Used to ensure only one thread accesses a critical section at a time.
     - **Semaphores**: Signals used to synchronize the start/stop of threads.
     - **Spinlocks**: A lock where threads constantly check a condition, used in multi-core systems.
     - **Condition Variables**: Used for signaling between threads to achieve coordination.
   
   **Deadlocks and Avoidance**:
   - A situation where threads are waiting indefinitely for resources held by each other.
   - Deadlock prevention strategies: Resource allocation order, avoiding circular wait.

### 7. **Multithreading vs Multiprocessing**
   - **Multithreading**:
     - Threads share the same memory space.
     - Lightweight and less memory overhead.
   - **Multiprocessing**:
     - Processes have their own memory space.
     - More isolated but higher memory consumption and creation overhead.
   - **Trade-offs**:
     - Multithreading: Higher risk of race conditions and data corruption.
     - Multiprocessing: Lower risk of data sharing issues but heavier on resources.

### 8. **Kernel Structures in Multithreading**
   - **Kernel Space vs User Space**:
     - Kernel space: Where the core of the OS functions, handling processes, and thread management.
     - User space: Where applications run. Threads in user space interact with kernel threads for execution.
   - **Context Switching**:
     - When the CPU switches between threads/processes, saving the state of the current thread and loading the state of the next thread.
     - Context switching is more efficient with threads than processes due to shared memory.

### 9. **Threading in Modern Systems**
   - **Multithreading in CPUs**:
     - Modern CPUs support simultaneous multithreading (SMT), like Intelâ€™s Hyper-Threading, allowing a core to run multiple threads concurrently.
   - **Application of Multithreading**:
     - Common in web servers, games, high-performance computing, and real-time systems.
   
### 10. **Challenges in Threading**
   - **Race Conditions**:
     - Occur when multiple threads modify shared resources concurrently, leading to unpredictable outcomes.
   - **Deadlock**:
     - Circular waiting on resources between threads.
   - **Livelock**:
     - Threads are not blocked, but keep changing states, never progressing.
   - **Priority Inversion**:
     - A lower-priority thread holds a resource required by a higher-priority thread, stalling its execution.

   - The role of the kernel in thread management and synchronization.
   - Challenges in multithreading and how they can be addressed using proper techniques.
