### **Memory Protection**
- The **Operating System (OS)** plays a crucial role in ensuring that Native Client (NaCl) applications don’t have unauthorized access to memory. 
- The OS uses **memory isolation techniques** to prevent NaCl’s sandboxed code from accessing memory areas that belong to other applications or the system itself.
- This ensures that the **NaCl code cannot read, write, or modify** critical system data or interfere with other running applications, thus maintaining overall system stability and security.

---

### **Process Isolation**
- The OS treats NaCl applications as **separate processes**. This means that NaCl applications are run in isolation from other system processes.
- By doing this, the OS ensures that NaCl applications cannot **interfere with or affect** the performance and functioning of other applications or system processes.
- This isolation is key to preventing NaCl applications from executing potentially harmful actions that could compromise system integrity or disrupt other running software.

---

### **System Call Management**
- **System calls** allow programs to request services from the OS, such as accessing files, using network resources, or interacting with hardware.
- NaCl imposes strict limitations on which system calls can be made by sandboxed code. The OS manages these calls by only allowing **whitelisted, safe system calls**, thereby **blocking access to sensitive system resources** like the file system or network unless explicitly permitted.
- This helps maintain a strong **security boundary** and prevents NaCl applications from accessing or modifying critical system resources without permission.

---

### **Interaction**
- The OS is responsible for **managing the sandbox environment** where NaCl code runs. It oversees **allocation of system resources** like CPU time, memory, and input/output operations for the NaCl process.
- This management ensures that NaCl applications are given the resources they need to operate while maintaining **strict control** over their interaction with the rest of the system.
- The OS also **monitors** the behavior of NaCl applications, ensuring that they stay within their sandboxed environment and don’t attempt to bypass security measures.

---

### **Security Handling**
- One of the OS’s primary roles with NaCl is **enforcing security policies**. It ensures that native code running within the NaCl sandbox cannot perform any actions that might harm the system, such as accessing sensitive files, making unsafe network requests, or interacting with hardware in ways that are not permitted.
- The OS constantly monitors the NaCl process, applying **security rules** to restrict what the native code can do, protecting both the user and the system from potential threats.

---

### **Portable Environment**
- **Portability** is a key feature of Native Client. The OS helps ensure that NaCl applications can run across multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) without needing significant changes.
- By providing a standardized environment and abstracting differences in **hardware architecture** and system resources, the OS allows NaCl applications to be written once and deployed on various platforms with minimal changes.
- This portability feature saves developers time and effort, making NaCl a useful tool for cross-platform development.

# Limitations

Complex Development​

Writing secure native applications requires deep knowledge of C/C++ and security practices.​
​

WebAssembly Competition​

WebAssembly (Wasm) has become more popular, offering similar benefits with simpler integration.​

​

Deprecation​

Google has moved away from supporting Native Client, focusing on WebAssembly instead.​
