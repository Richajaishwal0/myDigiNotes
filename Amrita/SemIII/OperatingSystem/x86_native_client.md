# Research: Native Client (Running X86) code directly from browser

Native client for me traditionally means not interpreted by a virtual execution environment or sandbox but executed by the CPU and bound to the operating system (think Win32). I'd contrast native with HTML, JVM, CLR, etc.

I'm pretty sure that at present, the term Native Client is only used to refer to Google Native Client (NaCl), which is a tool for running native code from within a browser, and yes in this case, Google definitely can explain it to you.
