# Research: Native Client (Running X86) code directly from browser

Native client for me traditionally means not interpreted by a virtual execution environment or sandbox but executed by the CPU and bound to the operating system (think Win32). I'd contrast native with HTML, JVM, CLR, etc.

I'm pretty sure that at present, the term Native Client is only used to refer to Google Native Client (NaCl), which is a tool for running native code from within a browser, and yes in this case, Google definitely can explain it to you.


Here’s a bullet-point breakdown to illustrate how the need for **Native Client (NaCl)** arose and how it fulfills those needs:

---

### **The Need for Native Client (NaCl)**

- **Performance Demands:**
  - Native code runs directly on the **CPU** and can fully utilize hardware resources, offering higher performance.
  - **Web applications** (e.g., games, video editing, simulations) require **high-performance computing** that interpreted languages like JavaScript can’t provide efficiently.
  - Executing **compute-intensive tasks** in the browser demands near-native performance, which standard web technologies cannot achieve.

- **Security Concerns:**
  - Running **untrusted native code** directly on a system opens up serious **security vulnerabilities** (e.g., unauthorized access to files or hardware resources).
  - Native code has **direct access to hardware** and can potentially **exploit system weaknesses** if not properly isolated.
  - There is a need for a system to run **untrusted code safely** while protecting the underlying system from malicious attacks.

- **Portability Issues:**
  - Native code is usually **architecture-specific** (e.g., x86, ARM) and tied to an operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS), making it difficult to run the same code across multiple platforms.
  - Developers need a way to write native code once and have it run on **different hardware architectures** without having to rewrite or recompile it for each platform.

---

### **How Native Client (NaCl) Fulfills the Need**

- **Sandboxing for Security:**
  - NaCl runs native code in a **sandbox**—an isolated environment that restricts the code’s access to system resources.
  - It enforces strict rules through **code validation** to prevent malicious actions, such as unauthorized system calls or memory access.
  - By isolating the native code, NaCl allows **untrusted code** to run **securely** within the browser without risking system integrity.

- **High Performance:**
  - NaCl allows native code to run at **near-native speeds** directly within a web browser, combining the speed of native execution with the convenience of web applications.
  - It leverages native CPU instruction sets (e.g., x86) for **optimal performance**, making it ideal for **high-performance web apps** like 3D games, simulations, and data processing.

- **Cross-Platform Portability:**
  - NaCl ensures **portability** by enabling the same native code to run on **multiple operating systems** (Windows, Linux, macOS) with minimal modification.
  - It supports various **instruction sets** (x86, ARM, MIPS) and uses architecture-neutral APIs to make native code run smoothly across different platforms.
  - Developers can write code once and run it anywhere NaCl is supported, reducing the effort of maintaining multiple versions of the same application.

- **Controlled Access to Resources:**
  - NaCl limits access to **system resources** through controlled APIs, allowing only secure and approved interactions with hardware and system files.
  - Only **whitelisted system calls** are allowed, ensuring the code cannot perform unsafe operations or access sensitive system information.

## Slide :

#### **Native Client (NaCl) Solution**
- **Native Client (NaCl)** is a **sandboxing technology** that allows **untrusted native code** to run securely in web browsers.
- Provides both **performance** (native execution speed) and **security** (sandboxing).
- Ensures **portability**, allowing the same code to run on different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) without modification.


### **Slide 4: NaCl Architecture Overview**
#### **How does Native Client work?**
1. **Sandboxing**: Native Client creates a sandbox environment to isolate native code from the system, preventing unauthorized access to the operating system or files.
   
2. **Validator**: Before execution, the code is passed through a **validator** to ensure it adheres to safety rules (e.g., no unauthorized memory access).
   
3. **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Supports execution on multiple architectures like **x86, ARM**, and **MIPS**. Native Client translates code to work across different platforms while ensuring portability.

4. **Native Client Modules (NaCl Modules)**: Native code is packaged in **NaCl modules**, which are validated and executed in the sandbox environment.

### **Slide 5: NaCl Security Model**
#### **Key Security Features**
- **Memory Sandboxing**: Ensures the code can’t access memory outside its designated area. This protects the system from malicious or faulty code.
  
- **Code Validation**: NaCl enforces strict validation rules before code can be executed. The code must follow certain patterns to avoid dangerous instructions.

- **Controlled System Calls**: Access to the underlying system is restricted, and only **whitelisted system calls** are allowed. This limits potential misuse.

- **Validator Role**: Ensures that no unsafe machine instructions (like privileged instructions or system calls) are allowed in the code.

### **Slide 6: Portability of NaCl**
#### **Cross-Platform Portability**
- NaCl allows the **same binary** to run across multiple platforms, ensuring that **developers don’t need to rewrite their code** for different operating systems.
  
- Uses a combination of **portable executable (PE)** format and **architecture-neutral APIs** to allow code execution on different systems.

- NaCl supports different instruction sets, including **x86, ARM, and MIPS**, ensuring its portability across different hardware.
