## Advanced Programming Worksheet-06

### 1. Create two classes DM and DB which store the value of distances:
- DM stores distances in meters and centimeters, and DB in feet and inches.
- Write a program that reads values for the class objects and adds one object DM with another object DB.
- Use a friend function to carry out the addition.
- The object that stores the results may be a DM object or DB object, depending on the units in which the results are required.
- The display should be in the format of feet and inches or meters and centimeters depending on the object on display.

**Program:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class DB;

class DM {
    int m;
    int cm;

    friend DM toDM(DM, DB);
    friend DB toDB(DM, DB);

public:
    DM() {}
    DM(int a, int b) : m{a}, cm{b} {}
    
    void print() {
        cout << m << "." << cm << "m" << endl;
    }
};

class DB {
    int ft;
    int in;

    friend DM toDM(DM, DB);
    friend DB toDB(DM, DB);

public:
    DB() {}
    DB(int a, int b) : ft{a}, in{b} {}

    void print() {
        cout << ft << "." << in << "ft" << endl;
    }
};

DM toDM(DM a, DB b) {
    int totalin = b.ft * 12;
    int totalcm = a.cm + totalin * 2.54;

    int m = a.m, cm = a.cm;

    while (totalcm >= 100) {
        m = m + 1;
        totalcm -= 100;
        cm = totalcm;
    }
    return DM(m, cm);
}

DB toDB(DM a, DB b) {
    int totalcm = a.m * 100;
    int totalin = b.in + (totalcm / 2.54);

    int ft = b.ft, in = b.in;

    while (totalin >= 12) {
        ft = ft + 1;
        totalin -= 12;
        in = totalin;
    }
    return DB(ft, in);
}

int main() {
    DM a(5, 3);
    DB b(1, 1);

    DM c = toDM(a, b);
    DB d = toDB(a, b);

    c.print();
    d.print();

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
5.03m
1.18ft
```

### 2. Bank Account Program
Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers: one called a savings account and the other a current account.
- The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but not cheque book facility.
- The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest.
- Current account holders should maintain a minimum balance, and if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.

**Program:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Account {
protected:
    string name;
    int account_no;
    double balance;

public:
    void setAccountDetails(const string& n, int accNo, double bal) {
        name = n;
        account_no = accNo;
        balance = bal;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Account Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Account Number: " << account_no << endl;
        cout << "Account Balance: " << balance << endl;
    }

    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        cout << "Deposited: " << amount << endl;
        cout << "Updated Balance: " << balance << endl;
    }

    virtual void withdraw(double amount) = 0;
};

class Savings : public Account {
public:
    void interest(double rate, int years) {
        double interestAmount = balance * pow((1 + (rate / 100)), years) - balance;
        balance += interestAmount;
        cout << "Interest added: " << interestAmount << endl;
        cout << "New balance: " << balance << endl;
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) override {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            cout << "Amount withdrawn: " << amount << endl;
            cout << "New balance: " << balance << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Insufficient balance!" << endl;
        }
    }
};

class Current : public Account {
private:
    double minimumBalance;
    double serviceCharge;

public:
    void setCurrentAccountDetails(double minBalance, double charge) {
        minimumBalance = minBalance;
        serviceCharge = charge;
    }

    void withdraw(double amount) override {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
            cout << "Amount withdrawn: " << amount << endl;
            if (balance < minimumBalance) {
                balance -= serviceCharge;
                cout << "Balance below minimum! Service charge imposed: " << serviceCharge << endl;
            }
            cout << "New balance: " << balance << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Insufficient balance!" << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Savings savingsAccount;
    savingsAccount.setAccountDetails("Alice", 101, 5000);
    savingsAccount.display();
    savingsAccount.deposit(2000);
    savingsAccount.interest(5, 2);
    savingsAccount.withdraw(3000);

    cout << endl;

    Current currentAccount;
    currentAccount.setAccountDetails("Bob", 102, 3000);
    currentAccount.setCurrentAccountDetails(2000, 100);
    currentAccount.display();
    currentAccount.deposit(1500);
    currentAccount.withdraw(4000);
    currentAccount.withdraw(500);

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Account Name: Alice
Account Number: 101
Account Balance: 5000
Deposited: 2000
Updated Balance: 7000
Interest added: 735.15
New balance: 7735.15
Amount withdrawn: 3000
New balance: 4735.15

Account Name: Bob
Account Number: 102
Account Balance: 3000
Deposited: 1500
Updated Balance: 4500
Amount withdrawn: 4000
New balance: 1500
Balance below minimum! Service charge imposed: 100
New balance: 1400
Amount withdrawn: 500
New balance: 900
```

### 3. Educational Institution Employee Database
An educational institution wishes to maintain a database of its employees. The database is divided into several classes as shown in the following hierarchy.

**Program:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Staff {
protected:
    string name;
    int code;

public:
    Staff(string n, int c) : name{n}, code{c} {}

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << " | Code: " << code << endl;
    }
};

class Teacher : public Staff {
    string subj;

public:
    Teacher(string name, int c, string sub) : Staff(name, c), subj{sub} {}

    void display() {
        Staff::display();
        cout << "Subject: " << subj << endl;
    }
};

class Officer : public Staff {
    string grade;

public:
    Officer(string name, int c, string grade) : Staff(name, c), grade{grade} {}

    void display() {
        Staff::display();
        cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
    }
};

class Typist : public Staff {
    int speed;

public:
    Typist(string name, int c, int speed) : Staff(name, c), speed{speed} {}

    void display() {
        Staff::display();
        cout << "Typing Speed: " << speed << " wpm" << endl;
    }
};

class RegularTypist : public Typist {
public:
    RegularTypist(string name, int c, int speed) : Typist(name, c, speed) {}

    void display() {
        Typist::display();
        cout << "Typist Type: Regular" << endl;
    }
};

class CasualTypist : public Typist {
    int wages;

public:
    CasualTypist(string name, int c, int speed, int w) : Typist(name, c, speed), wages{w} {}

    void display() {
        Typist::display();
        cout << "Typist Type: Casual" << " | Daily Wage: " << wages << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Teacher t("Mr. Sharma", 101, "Maths");
    RegularTypist rt("Ms. Anjali", 102, 75);
    CasualTypist ct("Mr. Raj", 103, 65, 300);
    Officer o("Ms. Priya", 104, "A");

    cout << "\nTeacher Details:\n";
    t.display();

    cout << "\nRegular Typist Details:\n";
    rt.display();

    cout << "\nCasual Typist Details:\n";
    ct.display();

    cout << "\nOfficer Details:\n";
    o.display();

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Teacher Details:
Name: Mr. Sharma | Code: 101
Subject: Maths

Regular Typist Details:
Name: Ms. Anjali | Code: 102
Typing Speed: 75 wpm
