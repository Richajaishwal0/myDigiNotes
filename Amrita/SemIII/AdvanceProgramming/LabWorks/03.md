# Lab - 3

## Task - 1

```cpp
/*
Create a class Box having length, breadth and height as private data members and count as static data member. The class uses a
constant member function getvolume() to return the product of length, breadth and height. The class uses static member function to
return the count of boxes created.
*/
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
private:
    double length, breadth, height; // Private data members
    static int count; // Static data member to keep track of the number of boxes created

public:
    // Constructor to initialize length, breadth, and height
    Box(double l, double b, double h) : length(l), breadth(b), height(h) {
        count++;  // Increment count each time a box is created
    }

    // Constant member function to calculate and return the volume of the box
    double getVolume() const {
        return length * breadth * height;
    }

    // Static member function to return the count of boxes created
    static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
};

// Initialize the static data member
int Box::count = 0;

int main() {
    // Creating objects of the Box class
    Box box1(2.5, 3.0, 4.0);
    Box box2(1.5, 2.0, 3.0);
    Box box3(3.0, 3.5, 2.0);

    // Display the volumes of the boxes
    cout << "Volume of Box 1: " << box1.getVolume() << endl;
    cout << "Volume of Box 2: " << box2.getVolume() << endl;
    cout << "Volume of Box 3: " << box3.getVolume() << endl;

    // Display the count of boxes created
    cout << "Total number of boxes created: " << Box::getCount() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Output

```bash
g++ -o out task5.cpp
./out
Volume of Box 1: 30
Volume of Box 2: 9
Volume of Box 3: 21
Total number of boxes created: 3
```
