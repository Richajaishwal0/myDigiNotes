# Lab 1

### Task -1
```cpp
You are given two strings, a, and b, separated by a new line. Each string will consist of lower case alphabets.
In the first line print two space-separated integers, representing the length of a and b respectively.
In the second line print the string produced by concatenating a and b.
In the third line print two strings separated by a space, a' and b'.  a' and b' are the same as a and b, respectively, except that their first characters are swapped.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	string str1;
	string str2;
	
	cin>>str1;
	cin>>str2;
	cout<< str1.length() << " " << str2.length()<<endl;
	cout<< str1+str2<<endl;

	string str3;
	string str4;
	str3 = str1;
	str4 = str2;
	str3[0] = str2[0];
	str4[0] = str1[0];
	cout << str3 << " " << str4 << endl;

	return 0;
}
