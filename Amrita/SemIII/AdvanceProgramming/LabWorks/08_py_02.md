# Python Programs Report

## 1. **Convert Kilometers to Miles**

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program to convert kilometers to miles.

**Code:**

```python
# Given kilometers
kilometers = 10

# Conversion factor
conversion_factor = 0.621371

# Converting kilometers to miles
miles = kilometers * conversion_factor

# Printing the result
print(f"{kilometers} kilometers is equal to {miles} miles.")
```

**Output:**

```
10 kilometers is equal to 6.21371 miles.
```

## 2. **Find the Square Root Without Using Built-in Function**

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program to find the square root without using a built-in function.

**Code:**

```python
# Given number
num = 16

# Using Newton's method to find the square root
guess = num / 2  # Initial guess
accuracy = 0.000001  # Define the accuracy

while abs(guess * guess - num) > accuracy:
    guess = (guess + num / guess) / 2

# Printing the square root
print(f"The square root of {num} is approximately {guess}.")
```

**Output:**

```
The square root of 16 is approximately 4.0.
```

## 3. **Calculate the Area of a Triangle**

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program to calculate the area of a triangle.

**Code:**

```python
# Given base and height of the triangle
base = 10
height = 5

# Calculating the area
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Printing the result
print(f"The area of the triangle is {area} square units.")
```

**Output:**

```
The area of the triangle is 25.0 square units.
```

## 4. **Swap Two Variables Using a Third Variable**

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program to swap two variables using a third variable.

**Code:**

```python
# Given two variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Using a third variable to swap
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

# Printing the swapped values
print(f"After swapping, a = {a} and b = {b}.")
```

**Output:**

```
After swapping, a = 10 and b = 5.
```

## 5. **Check if the User is Permitted to Vote**

**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program to print the message ‘You are permitted to vote’ when the user-entered age is above 17.

**Code:**

```python
# Getting the user's age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Checking if the user is permitted to vote
if age > 17:
    print("You are permitted to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not permitted to vote.")
```

**Output (example):**

```
Enter your age: 18
You are permitted to vote.
```
