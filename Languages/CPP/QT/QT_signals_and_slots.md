# This note is about signals and slots in QT

In Qt, signals and slots are used for communication between objects. Signals are emitted when a particular event occurs, and slots are functions that are called in response to a particular signal. This mechanism allows for a loosely coupled design, making the code more modular and reusable.

### Basic Concepts

1. **Signals**: 
   - These are emitted by an object when a particular event occurs.
   - They do not need to be explicitly defined; Qt provides many built-in signals, and you can also define your own.
   
2. **Slots**: 
   - These are functions that respond to signals.
   - They can be any member function, a lambda function, or a stand-alone function.

3. **Connecting Signals to Slots**: 
   - This is done using the `connect` function, which establishes a connection between a signal and a slot.
   - When the signal is emitted, the connected slot is invoked.

### Syntax of `connect`

The `connect` function has the following general syntax:

```cpp
QObject::connect(sender, SIGNAL(signal), receiver, SLOT(slot));
```

However, in modern Qt (Qt 5 and later), the syntax has been updated to use function pointers and lambdas for type safety and better performance:

```cpp
QObject::connect(sender, &SenderClass::signal, receiver, &ReceiverClass::slot);
```

### Example with Basic Concepts

Let's look at a simple example where a `QPushButton`'s `clicked` signal is connected to a custom slot in a `MainWindow` class.

#### mainwindow.h

```cpp
#ifndef MAINWINDOW_H
#define MAINWINDOW_H

#include <QMainWindow>
#include <QPushButton>

class MainWindow : public QMainWindow
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    MainWindow(QWidget *parent = nullptr);
    ~MainWindow();

private slots:
    void handleButtonClicked();

private:
    QPushButton *button;
};

#endif // MAINWINDOW_H
```

#### mainwindow.cpp

```cpp
#include "mainwindow.h"
#include <QVBoxLayout>

MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent)
    : QMainWindow(parent)
{
    button = new QPushButton("Click Me", this);

    QVBoxLayout *layout = new QVBoxLayout;
    layout->addWidget(button);

    QWidget *centralWidget = new QWidget(this);
    centralWidget->setLayout(layout);
    setCentralWidget(centralWidget);

    // Connecting the button's clicked signal to the handleButtonClicked slot
    connect(button, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MainWindow::handleButtonClicked);
}

MainWindow::~MainWindow()
{
}

void MainWindow::handleButtonClicked()
{
    button->setText("Button Clicked");
}
```

### Explanation of Data Flow

1. **Signal Emission**:
   - When the button is clicked, the `clicked` signal is emitted.
   - This signal is predefined by the `QPushButton` class.

2. **Signal-Slot Connection**:
   - The `connect` function establishes a connection between the button's `clicked` signal and the `handleButtonClicked` slot of the `MainWindow` class.
   - `connect(button, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MainWindow::handleButtonClicked);`
     - `button`: The sender object emitting the signal.
     - `&QPushButton::clicked`: The signal being emitted.
     - `this`: The receiver object handling the signal.
     - `&MainWindow::handleButtonClicked`: The slot to be called when the signal is emitted.

3. **Slot Invocation**:
   - When the `clicked` signal is emitted, the `handleButtonClicked` slot is invoked.
   - Inside `handleButtonClicked`, we change the button's text to "Button Clicked".

### Lambda Functions

You can also use lambda functions for slots if the slot is simple and doesn't require a separate function:

```cpp
connect(button, &QPushButton::clicked, this, [this]() {
    button->setText("Button Clicked");
});
```

### Summary

- **Signals** are emitted by objects when events occur.
- **Slots** are functions that respond to signals.
- **connect** establishes a connection between signals and slots, allowing for event-driven programming.
- The modern syntax for `connect` is more type-safe and preferred over the older string-based syntax.
