**Multilevel Inheritance** is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a class is derived from another derived class. This means that a single base class can be inherited by a derived class, which in turn is inherited by another class, forming a chain of inheritance.

### Key Points:
1. **Base Class:** The original class from which other classes inherit.
2. **Intermediate Class:** A class that is derived from the base class and is itself a base class for another derived class.
3. **Derived Class:** The class that inherits from the intermediate class, thus indirectly inheriting from the base class.

### Example:

Let's consider a simple example using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base Class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Animal eats." << endl;
    }
};

// Intermediate Class
class Mammal : public Animal {
public:
    void sleep() {
        cout << "Mammal sleeps." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived Class
class Dog : public Mammal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog barks." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog myDog;

    // Accessing methods from the base class
    myDog.eat();  // Animal eats.

    // Accessing methods from the intermediate class
    myDog.sleep(); // Mammal sleeps.

    // Accessing methods from the derived class
    myDog.bark();  // Dog barks.

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`Animal` Class**: This is the base class with a method `eat()`.
2. **`Mammal` Class**: This class inherits from `Animal` and adds its own method `sleep()`.
3. **`Dog` Class**: This class inherits from `Mammal`, thus also inheriting the properties of `Animal`, and adds its own method `bark()`.

In this example:
- `Dog` is a derived class that inherits features from `Mammal`.
- `Mammal` inherits features from `Animal`, so `Dog` indirectly inherits features from `Animal` through `Mammal`.

### Real-World Example:

Consider a real-world scenario where you have:

- **`Person`** as a base class (with attributes like `name` and `age`).
- **`Employee`** as an intermediate class derived from `Person` (with additional attributes like `employeeID` and `department`).
- **`Manager`** as a derived class from `Employee` (with additional methods like `manageTeam()`).

This structure reflects a hierarchy where `Manager` has all properties and methods of `Employee` and `Person`, forming a multilevel inheritance chain.

### Summary:
Multilevel inheritance helps in building a hierarchy of classes and reusing code across multiple levels of the hierarchy, which can be beneficial in structuring complex systems.
