Chatgpt Ans:
The 4 bytes that you're seeing between the `int vertex` and the `struct node *next` pointer are likely due to **padding**. In C, structures are often padded to ensure that the members are aligned in memory in a way that optimizes access speed.

Here's what is probably happening in your case:

1. **Alignment**: The `int` type typically has an alignment requirement of 4 bytes, and pointers (on a 64-bit system) often have an alignment requirement of 8 bytes. The compiler may insert padding after the `int` to ensure that the pointer starts at an 8-byte boundary, which is required for efficient memory access on some architectures.

2. **Structure layout**:
   - The `int vertex` (4 bytes) is stored first.
   - After that, there are 4 bytes of padding to align the `struct node *next` (which is an 8-byte pointer) at an 8-byte boundary.
   - Then, the `struct node *next` pointer (8 bytes) follows.

In total, the struct size becomes 16 bytes, instead of the expected 12 bytes, due to the additional 4 bytes of padding.

### Example:
If your struct looks like this:

```c
struct node {
    int vertex;        // 4 bytes
    struct node *next; // 8 bytes (on a 64-bit system)
};
```

The memory layout could look like this:

- `vertex`: 4 bytes
- `padding`: 4 bytes (for alignment)
- `next`: 8 bytes

This results in 16 bytes of memory used for the struct, with those extra 4 bytes being unused padding.

### Solution/Workaround:
If you want to remove the padding, you can use compiler-specific pragmas or attributes to pack the structure, but this may come at the cost of performance, as unaligned accesses may be slower.

For example, in GCC, you could do:

```c
struct __attribute__((packed)) node {
    int vertex;
    struct node *next;
};
```

However, I would recommend leaving the padding unless you're working in a memory-constrained environment where every byte matters.
