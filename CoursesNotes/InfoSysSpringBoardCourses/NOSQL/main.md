# Note taken for Infosys SpringBoard NoSQL Course

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
Identify the right database implementation for a given business requirement

- Apply Consistency Availability Partition tolerance (CAP) theorem and business parameters to select the most appropriate NoSQL (Not only SQL) database

- You will learn this by analyzing four real life big data implementation scenarios.  

---

The two stages mentioned below help you design the database infrastructure of the eCommerce system under consideration.

- Stage 1: For each component, identify the most relevant data model, consistency level and the read/write load required

- Stage 2: Map the outcome of Stage 1 to the characteristics of few popular NoSQL databases to choose the most suitable one

---

As part of Stage 1, for each eCommerce component, you will do the following.  

1.1 Identify data model
Is your data text-based / key-value / flexible / structured / highly related to one another?

1.2 Choose consistency level
Does it require stronger consistency or higher availability?

1.3 Analyze whether operations are read/write intensive
Does it mostly involve read or write operations?

---

This step begins by identifying the most suitable NoSQL category below for each component of the eCommerce system:

a) Key-value stores

b) Column-family stores

c) Document-oriented databases

d) Graph-based databases
