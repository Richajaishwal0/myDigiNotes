## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive toolkit that assists system administrators and security professionals in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in Linux servers. This tool aims to enhance the security posture of servers by providing detailed assessments and actionable insights.

## Goals
- **Port Scanning:** Identify open ports and detect vulnerable services running on those ports.
- **Security Misconfiguration Checks:** Detect common security misconfigurations in the Linux system.
- **Web Application Security Scanning:** Perform basic scans for web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **OS and Software Fingerprinting:** Identify the operating system and software versions to detect potential vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Prioritization and Severity Rating:** Rate detected vulnerabilities based on their severity to prioritize remediation efforts.
- **Patch Management Integration:** Identify missing patches and provide recommendations for patching.
- **Brute Force Attack Testing:** Test system passwords using brute force techniques to identify weak passwords.

## Implementation Plan
To implement the Vulnerability Assessment Tool, we will follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   - Install necessary development tools and libraries.
   - Set up version control with Git.

2. **Port Scanning:**
   - Implement port scanning functionality using `libpcap` for packet capture and analysis.
   - Integrate with Nmap for comprehensive port and service scanning.

3. **Security Misconfiguration Checks:**
   - Develop scripts to check for common misconfigurations in Linux system settings.
   - Implement automated checks for SSH configurations, file permissions, and more.

4. **Web Application Security Scanning:**
   - Implement basic scans for common web application vulnerabilities.
   - Integrate with tools like OWASP ZAP for more comprehensive scanning.

5. **OS and Software Fingerprinting:**
   - Implement techniques for OS detection and software version identification.
   - Use banner grabbing and packet analysis to gather necessary information.

6. **Vulnerability Prioritization and Severity Rating:**
   - Use CVSS scores to rate the severity of detected vulnerabilities.
   - Implement a risk assessment module to prioritize vulnerabilities based on context.

7. **Patch Management Integration:**
   - Identify missing patches and updates for the target system.
   - Provide patch recommendations based on detected vulnerabilities.

8. **Brute Force Attack Testing:**
   - Implement password brute forcing techniques.
   - Test system passwords and report weak passwords.

## Project Plan
To successfully complete this project, we will:
- Conduct thorough research and planning for each feature.
- Implement each module incrementally and test thoroughly.
- Continuously integrate and test each feature as part of the overall toolkit.
- Gather feedback from potential users and make necessary improvements.
- Document the entire process and provide clear usage instructions for end-users.

## Prerequisites
To run and develop this toolkit, you will need:
- A Linux operating system (preferably Ubuntu or Debian-based)
- Development tools (GCC, G++, CMake)
- Libraries: `libpcap`, `libboost-all-dev`
- Security tools: Nmap, Metasploit, OWASP ZAP

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnerability-assessment-tool.git
   cd vulnerability-assessment-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake libpcap-dev libboost-all-dev nmap
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run the toolkit:**
   ```sh
   ./vulnerability-assessment-tool
   ```
