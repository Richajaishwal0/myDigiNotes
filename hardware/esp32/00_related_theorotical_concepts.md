## Edge on AI

Edge computing or AI on Edge is a technology that allows artificial intelligence algorithms to run on small, low-power devices like microcontrollers or microprocessors. This approach aims to reduce costs and enhance system performance by processing data locally, rather than sending it to distant servers. While cloud computing has been popular due to its lower initial setup and maintenance costs, advancements in technology now make edge computing a viable and efficient option. In essence, edge computing brings powerful processing capabilities directly to where the data is generated, making systems faster and more efficient.
