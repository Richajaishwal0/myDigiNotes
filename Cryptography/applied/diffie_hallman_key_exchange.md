# Diffie-Hellman KeyExchange

```python
# Example parameters (small values for simplicity, real values should be much larger)

def generator(g, x, p):
    return pow(g, x) % p

p = 23  # Prime number
g = 5   # Generator

# Alice's private key
a = 6
# Bob's private key
b = 15

# Alice's public key
A = generator(g, a, p)
# Bob's public key
B = generator(g, b, p)

# Shared secret key (computed by both parties independently)
shared_key_alice = generator(B, a, p)
shared_key_bob = generator(A, b, p)

print(shared_key_alice == shared_key_bob)  # Should be True

```
## How Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is able to exchange keys over an insecure channel. 

### **Steps 1:** Agreeing on parameters
- Both parties agrees on large prime numbers p and a base g (also called as generator). The value need not be kept secret and can be known to anyone. 

### **Step 2:** Private Key Selection
 - Alice selects a private key ùëé a (a random number) which she keeps secret.
 - Bob selects a private key ùëè b (a random number) which he keeps secret.

### **Step 3:** Public Key Computation
 - Alice computes her public key A using the generator function: A = g^a mod p.
 - Bob computes his public key B using the generator function: B = g^b mod p. 

### **Step 4:** Public Key Exchange
 - Alice sends her public key A to Bob.
 - Bob sends his public key B to Alice.

**This Exchange can occur over an insecure channel because knowing the public keys A and B doesn't allow an attacker to easily determine the private keys a and b due to the hardness of discrete logarithm problem**

### **Step 5:** Shared Key Computation
- Alice receives Bob's public key B and computes the shared secret key s: s = B^a mod p
- Bob receives Alice's public key A and computes the shared secret key s: s = A^b mod p
