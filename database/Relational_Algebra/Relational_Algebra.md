### Import Points:

  

  

PI (Projection):
================

  

PI -> only fetches unique rows (i.e. no duplicates)

### Sigma: Selection Operator

It is used for selection of rows.

Note: Use selection operator inside and PI operator outside

  

  

### Cross Product in Relational Algebra

*   Minimum two tables are required. They can be same though
*   At least one of the column should be common
*   No. of Columns (cross product) = No. of columns in table1 + No. of columns in table2)
*   No. of rows (Cross Product) = No. of rows in table1 \* No. of rows in table2

### Set Difference in Relational Algebra

A - B = A U B (comp)

Q. Find the students who are not employees

  

  

### Division Operation in Relational Algebra

The division operator is used for queries which involve the 'all'.

R1 รท R2 = tuples of R1 associated with all tuples of R2.

  

Q. Find the list of students who have enrolled in both the courses

  

  

### Union Operation:

*   No. of columns must be same in no.
*   Corresponding column should be of same domain
*   Column name is determined by left table

###   

### Tuple Calculus

Relational Calculus: Two types:

  

*   Tuple Relational Calculus
*   Domain Relational Calculus
