**Single Layer Perceptron:** <br>
Perceptron is also known as an artificial neural network. Perceptron is mainly used to compute the logical gate like AND, OR, and NOR which has binary input and binary output.

The main functionality of the perceptron is:-
- Takes input from the input layer
- Weight them up and sum it up.
- Pass the sum to the nonlinear function to produce the output.
