Clustering is a fundamental concept in unsupervised learning, where the goal is to group similar data points together without using labeled data. Let me break down the basic concept of clustering, followed by a roadmap to help you master clustering-based models.

### Basic Concept of Clustering

**Clustering** involves dividing a dataset into groups (clusters) such that data points in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Unlike supervised learning, where we have labels, clustering finds structure in data that isn't explicitly provided.

**Key Elements**:
1. **Distance Metric**: Clustering algorithms rely on a distance metric to quantify similarity between data points, such as Euclidean, Manhattan, or cosine distance.
2. **Cluster Centroids**: Many algorithms (e.g., K-Means) work by computing the center (centroid) of clusters.
3. **Number of Clusters**: Some methods (e.g., K-Means) require the number of clusters (K) as input, while others (e.g., DBSCAN) determine it automatically.

### Common Clustering Algorithms:
1. **K-Means**: Divides data into K clusters by minimizing the distance of data points to the cluster centroid.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree of clusters, either via agglomeration (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) methods.
3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Groups together points that are closely packed and marks outliers (points in low-density areas).
4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Assumes that data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.
