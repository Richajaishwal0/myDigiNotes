# Babel

> Babel is a javascript compiler

Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

- Transform syntax
- Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js))
- Source code transformations (codemods)



--> Babel can convert JSX syntax

--> Babel can strip out type annotations!
