# Converting to fraction


### Working rule
- Assume the given number x
- multiply it by 10^n so that numbers after decimal are completely recurring
- multiply it by next 10^m (m>n) so that the number after decimal are completely recurring
- Subtract and evaulate it

### Type 1: 3.121212... (recurring starts right after decimal)

x = 3.121212...
100x = 312.121212...
on solving, x = 309/99 = 103/33

### Type 2: 0.123232323... (recurring doesn't start immediately after decimal)

10x = 1.232323....
1000x = 123.232323...
On Solving, x = 122/990
